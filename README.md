## FAQ

#### What technologies were used to develop TuneHub, and how do they contribute to the platform's functionality?

TuneHub is built with Java for the backend, leveraging Spring Boot to handle server-side operations, such as managing user requests and data processing. The front end is developed using HTML, CSS, and Thymeleaf templates provided by Spring Boot, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface. MySQL was used for database management to store music files, user information, and playlists.

#### How does TuneHub handle user interactions and data flow between the front end and back end?

TuneHub uses REST APIs to enable communication between the front end and back end. When a user interacts with the app, such as searching for a song or creating a playlist, the request is sent to the backend where the logic is processed. The results are then dynamically rendered on the front end using Thymeleaf templates, providing users with real-time responses.
